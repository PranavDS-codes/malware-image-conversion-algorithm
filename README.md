# Malware Image Analysis Optimization Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and results of Phase 2 of the Malware Image Analysis Project. The goal of Phase 2 is to optimize the conversion of malware executables into image representations and to benchmark the new proposed method against the traditional approach. This optimization aims to enhance malware detection capabilities by making the conversion process more efficient and scalable.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Malware_Analysis_Optimization_Project.git
   cd Malware_Analysis_Optimization_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and run the desired notebook to benchmark the existing or proposed method:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebooks/existing_method_benchmarking/Linear-based-1.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run Python Scripts**:
   You can also execute the Python scripts directly to convert malware files to images:

   ```sh
   python src/proposed_method.py
   ```

## Phase 2 Summary

In Phase 2, we focused on optimizing the image conversion process used for malware executables. The key improvements include:

- **Efficient Data Reading**: The optimized method reads file data in one go, significantly reducing I/O operations.
- **Unified Image Creation**: A single function handles both grayscale and RGB images, reducing code redundancy.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: The proposed method scales better for large datasets, as demonstrated through extensive benchmarking.

The benchmarking results show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional approach in terms of memory usage, processing time, and scalability. Detailed findings and metrics are provided in the `phase2_methodology.md` document.

## Results

- **Memory Usage**: The optimized method reduced peak memory usage by approximately 20% compared to the traditional approach.
- **Processing Time**: CPU time was reduced by nearly 47%, indicating faster analysis capabilities.
- **Scalability**: The optimized method showed a slower rate of increase in resource consumption, making it suitable for larger workloads.
